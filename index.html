							<h2>Good Gourd</h2>
							<p>Oh my gourd! This black swan of the pumpkin family makes us feel bad for it and the unfortunate growths it contains. As we dwell on how to make the gourd feel beautiful, we learn to appreciate the bright orange beauty of true pumpkins.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/pumpkin.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/pumpkin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>The Multicolored Pumpkin</h2>
							<p>The framing of this photo is to capture the attraction of the pumpkin, which makes us feel the photographer was spying on the pumpkin. We don't want to get caught sneaking a picture!</p>

							<h2>Rustic Wheel</h2>
							<p>Did you know that these pumpkins are called "knuckle heads". These pumpkins are genetically engineered for over ten years to achieve their maximum amount of warts. Why would anyone want a warty pumpkin?</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/apples.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/apples.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Apple of my Eye</h2>

							<a href="images/fulls/corn.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/corn.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Autumn Corn</h2>
							<p>What did the corn say when it received a compliment? Aw, shucks. This colorful corn let's us know the fresh corn on the cob days are coming to an end, and instead we will be using it as decorations around the house.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/wheelbarrow.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/wheelbarrow.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<a href="images/fulls/bike.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/bike.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Old Bike</h2>
							<p>Why couldn't Cinderella win the bicycle race? She has a pumpkin for a coach! This rustic bike captured my attention as it was alone on a cold fall day. As I took the pictures I wondered where the bike had rode to in its prime before growing old and lonely.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">

							<a href="images/fulls/tire.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/tire.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>White Pumpkins</h2>
							<p>What do you call an athletic gourd? A jack o'lantern! Another fun picture of gourds and knuckle heads captured through framing of another great gourd. I wanted to draw attention to the far pumpkins to ensure my audience admired the beauty of the white and orange.</p>

									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>My name is Maddie Laycock and I am a senior at Virginia Tech. I am double majoring in Human Development and Communication. In the fall of 2018 I was able to take a class that expanded my knowledge on visual media. I learned basic visual design skills for layouts, photography, websites and videos. I was able to recognize how to combine various communication media into a comprehensive and coherent message, and want to express my techniques and learnings to the public through this website.   </p>
									<p> For my fall photos, I wanted to take the approach of capturing bright colors and different fall foods. I focused a lot on close up images but added concepts like leading lines, framing and contrast to capture pictures that interest my audience. I hope you enjoy my work and please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments! </p>
